# Event-Sentinel-Automated-Windows-Log-Analysis-with-PowerShell
Event Sentinel ‚Äì Automated Windows Log Analysis with PowerShell: Built a PowerShell script to automate collection and parsing of Windows event logs from Security, System, and Application channels. Extracted key Event IDs (4624, 4625, 4688, etc.) and generated CSV reports to enhance SOC visibility and streamline threat detection.

#üß† Overview

Event Sentinel is a PowerShell-based automation tool designed to collect, parse, and analyze critical Windows Event Logs. It helps security analysts and SOC teams streamline log investigation by automatically exporting and parsing important event data such as logon attempts, process creation, and system activities.

This project demonstrates intermediate-level PowerShell scripting skills, covering automation, error handling, and Windows event management.
